## A title 
Makeup Painter

## Your group’s members
Kathryn Totushek and Claire Kuno

## A brief description (think of a single sentence / catchphrase)
A makeup visualizing tool that allows the user to choose shades of eye, lip, and face makeup. 

## Drawings, if appropriate – could be the UI, or a high-level diagram of the workflow / user interaction, etc.
Face.java (contains the graphics for the shape of the face, eyes, nose, lips, etc.)
Color.java (add for the more complex coloring by creating bounds for the application of blurred shades on the canvas)
MakeupPainter.java (creates the main canvas)
Makeup.java (the different types of makeup)
	Eyeshadow.java
	Blush.java
	Lipstick.java
	Lashes.java

## Tell us why your project is cool, interesting, useful, and so on!
Our project allows the user to have full creative reign on creating makeup on a face however they want to. 

## Describe a smaller, initial version of your project that you can build first. This will be a prototype, or proof of concept, or “minimum viable product”. Something with a scope smaller than the full project.
Instead of drawing the makeup, the user will be able to just click on an area of the face and the area will automatically get colored in. 

## You should have shared your project idea with students outside your group. What did they say?
That's pretty cool, from Jason.
