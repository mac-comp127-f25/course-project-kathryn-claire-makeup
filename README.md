# Makeup App

## Project Title
	Makeup App!

## Names of your team members
	Kathryn Totushek and Claire Kuno

## Project description:
	- Give a one-sentence description of your project, so that somebody considering pulling the code knows what to expect.

	The Makeup App! is an interactive interface that allows the user to draw on the faces of Mona Lisa, Marilyn Monroe, and Frida Kahlo using blush, bronzer, and eyeshadow as the selective pigments.

	- Give a brief technical guide to running your code:
		- What are its technical requirements? (At a minimum, it requires that you have Java 17/21 installed, because that’s what Kilt Graphics requires. Anything else?)
		- How should somebody run the program? Where is the main class?

	The technical requirements end with the installation of Kilt Graphics and interacting with the program starts by running the main method, MakeupApp.java.
		
	- Acknowledge any help, references, inspiration, or outside resources you used. If your game includes any art or sound assets, or includes the work of others in any way, credit the creator(s) and link to the source(s).

	We acknowledge the help and inspiration we got from the Painter App homework from this course. Our game puts the paint graphics from Painter into context with the help of the Critters in-class activity for inputting images into our interface.

## Known issues:
	- Are there fundamental design limitations that users should be aware of?
	- Are there specific bugs, glitches, or shortcomings that users should be aware of?

	There are currently no design limitations that users should be aware of as every button fulfills the function of their description. There are shortcomings on the freedom users have when interacting with the interface, but that is a product of the intentions behind our code. For example, there is only one eye shadow color and all pigments have a designated color, opacity, and size.

## Societal impact:
	- Please write about how your project abides by ethical considerations and socially responsible computing practices. Be mindful that anything created by humans, including software, can carry embedded biases and have unintended consequences. In every software project, you must consider the ways in which your program can promote justice or heighten injustices, either through unintentional effects or through malicious misuse.

	Our project abides by ethical considerations and socially responsible computing practices through the construction of our code and the ideas that we conceived to create it. The most important part is the ethical and responsible considerations of our game idea, and the recreational aspect of the Makeup App has clear intentions for fun and creative practices. Secondly, our program promotes inclusivity and avoids malicious misuse or injustices in its broad audience and how it is a game that showcases what COMP127 has taught us. 

	- This may seem like an odd question. For example, Breakout cannot possibly have negative consequences…right? It is just a game, and such a simple little game at that! But can a blind person play it? What about somebody who uses an assistive device instead of a mouse?

	- Consider equitable practices in software like inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity. Think about the ways in which the code you write or software you produce may or may not contribute to society. Here are more specific questions to ask yourself:
		- Does your code have the potential to exclude or cause harm to vulnerable populations?
		- In what ways do you anticipate your software project being used in malicious and oppressive situations?
		- Could there be unintended consequences of your software creation?

	- Note that you do not need to fix every problem you identify. Our goal is for you to develop an awareness of these issues early on in your computing journey. Being able to identify and raise ethical concerns in your software work is an important skill to have. We want you to start developing that skill now.
